            <p>Magnolia grandiflora is a medium to large evergreen tree which may grow 120 ft (37 m) tall.[6] It typically has a single stem (or trunk) and a pyramidal shape.[7] The leaves are simple and broadly ovate, 12–20 cm (4+3⁄4–7+3⁄4 in) long and 6–12 cm (2+1⁄4–4+3⁄4 in) broad,[7] with smooth margins. They are dark green, stiff, and leathery, and often scurfy underneath with yellow-brown pubescence.<img src="Assets/magnolia-medium.jpg" class="medium right-align" alt="Medium Magnolia Flower"></p>

        <h2 class="header-background">Physical Description</h2>
        <p class="para-background">Magnolia plants can be evergreen or deciduous and bear alternate smooth-margined leaves. The flowers, usually cuplike and fragrant, are located at the branch tips and have three sepals, six to 12 petals arranged in two to four series, and many spirally arranged stamens. The numerous simple ovaries in the centre later form a conelike fruit known as an aggregate of follicles. Each follicle of the fruit bears a single seed. The seeds, usually reddish, often hang pendulously by slender threads.
            Well-known Asian species of the genus Magnolia include lily magnolia (M. liliiflora), a 4-metre (13-foot) shrubby tree that has purple blossoms with white interiors and brownish fruits; yulan magnolia (M. denudata), a 60-metre (nearly 200-foot) tree; saucer magnolia (M. ×soulangeana), a gray-barked hybrid between the lily magnolia and the yulan magnolia, which has flowers that may be white, pink, crimson, or purplish; Oyama magnolia (M. sieboldii), a 9-metre (30-foot) tree with crimson fruits; and star magnolia (M. stellata), of similar height with spidery flowers.

        <h2>Image Rollovers and Sprites</h2>
        <p>
             When a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it is known as a <b>rollover</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a <b>sprite</b>.

        <p id="gradients">CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box. The gradient is created using the background-image property and, at the time of writing, different browsers required a different syntax.
            Since it is not supported by all browsers, it is possible to specify a background image for the box first (which would represent the gradient) and then provide the CSS alternatives for browsers that support gradients.
            On this page, we are focusing on linear gradients. You can see that in order to create a linear gradient, we need to specify two colors (that the gradient is between).</p>
